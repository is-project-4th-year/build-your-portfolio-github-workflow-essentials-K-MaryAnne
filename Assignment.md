## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program
**🧠 What I Thought I'd Learn vs What I Actually Learned**
**1. Concept: Commit Messages**

`Expectation 👀` : I thought commit messages were just quick notes for myself, like “changed stuff”.

`Reality 😅`: I learned that clear, structured commit messages make it so much easier to track what changed, when, and why especially In a team.

`Impact 💡`: Writing proper commit messages helped me keep track of changes in my portfolio, like when I updated images or tweaked layouts. It made reviewing my own history less painful.

**2. Concept: Merge Conflicts**

`Expectation 👀` : I genuinely struggled to understand what they were and how to fix them. They felt like a nightmare.

`Reality 😅`: Once I saw what conflict markers looked like and learned how to resolve them with VS Code, it started to make sense. They’re still annoying, but no longer terrifying.

`Impact 💡`: Now, I can confidently resolve merge conflicts in my portfolio project when switching between branches or pulling new changes.

**3. Concept: Branch Naming and Workflow**

`Expectation 👀` : I assumed branch names didn’t really matter.

`Reality 😅`: Clear, descriptive branch names  are so important and helpful when working on multiple features or bugs.

`Impact 💡`: Using structured branch names helped me stay organized while building different sections of my portfolio website.

**4. Concept: git pull vs git fetch**

`Expectation 👀` :  honestly thought git pull and git fetch were basically the same thing 😭

`Reality 😅`:  learned that git fetch only downloads changes without applying them, while git pull downloads and merges them into your current branch. That small difference caused a lot of confusion at first.

`Impact 💡`: Understanding the distinction made me more intentional with my commands.
